# Great Expectations Test

This is a small skeleton project for testing Data Replication and Data quality monitoring.

It currently consists of a MySQL instance and a postgres isntance which are initially synchronised using replicadb.
Test data and SQL initialisation scripts can be placed in the mysql_raw folder.

Download replica DB and place it in the root directory, you may need to update the docker file with the new name.
